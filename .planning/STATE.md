# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** City planners can explore where heat risk is highest across King County tracts, simulate the impact of interventions, and get AI-assisted reasoning — all through a fast, queryable JSON API.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Roadmap created; all 20 v1 requirements mapped across 4 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: none yet

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-scored predictions served from DuckDB — no live baseline inference in v1
- Parametric formulas for what-if (no model re-inference) — formulas sufficient for policy guidance
- Single read-only DuckDB connection opened at lifespan startup, shared via dependency injection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Simulation): Parametric formula coefficients (delta-T per % tree canopy, per albedo delta, per sqft green space) are not yet documented. Must be sourced before Phase 3 planning begins.
- Phase 2 (Geometry): `king_county.duckdb` geometry CRS and actual table/column names must be verified against the real file before writing DuckDB queries.
- Phase 4 (Chat): Claude model selection (Opus vs Sonnet) and context token budget strategy need confirmation before chat endpoint is finalized.
